# W3bstream

## Overview

W3bStream is a general framework for connecting data generated by devices and machines in the physical world to the blockchain world. In a nutshell, W3bStream uses the IoTeX blockchain to orchestrate a decentralized network of gateways (i.e., W3bStream nodes) that streams encrypted data from IoT devices and machines and generates proofs of real-world facts to different blockchains. An overview graphic of W3bstream is

## Run W3bstream with prebuilt docker images

### Run W3bstream node with W3bstream Studio
Check it out here [w3bstream-studio](https://github.com/machinefi/w3bstream-studio#run-w3bstream-node-with-prebuilt-docker-images).


### Run W3bstream node without W3bstream Studio

Make a path for w3bstream node. In the path, run the following command

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/machinefi/w3bstream/main/docker-compose.yaml > docker-compose.yaml
```

Edit the config in the `yaml` file if needed. Then run

```bash
docker-compose -p w3bstream -f ./docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

Your node should be up and running. 

Please note: the docker images are hosted at [GitHub Docker Registry](https://github.com/machinefi/w3bstream/pkgs/container/w3bstream)

## Run W3bstream node from code

If you are interested in diving into the code and run the node using a locally built docker, here is the steps of building the docker image from code.

### Build docker image from code

```bash
make build_backend_image
```

### Run server in docker containers

```bash
 make run_docker
 ```

 ### Stop server running in docker containers
 ```bash
 make stop_docker
 ```
 ### Delete docker resources
 ```bash
 make drop_docker
 ```

## Interact with W3bstream using CLI

Please refer to [HOWTO.md](./HOWTO.md) for more details.
